# Anonymous type

<a href=https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb397696.aspx>Anonymous types</a> provide a convenient way to encapsulate a set of read-only properties into a single object without having to explicitly define a type first. The type name is generated by the compiler and is not available at the source code level. The type of each property is inferred by the compiler.
You create anonymous types by using the new operator together with an object initializer. For more information about object initializers, see Object and Collection Initializers.
